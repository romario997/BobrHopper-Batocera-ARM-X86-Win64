// O23: does a second pad really reach only the second player?
//
// The R36S has one built-in controller, so a second player needs a second pad plugged in - and the author has no
// second pad to try it with. This test supplies one: SDL can attach VIRTUAL joysticks (SDL_JoystickAttachVirtual,
// 2.0.14+), so two pads are created here, opened through the game's own Input::init, and pressed one at a time.
//
// What it proves and what it does not:
//   * PROVES that Input tells two SDL devices apart by the instance id carried on every event, that each ends up
//     on its own device index, and that pressing one never shows up on the other. That is the whole of the
//     per-pad logic, and it is the same source file the R36S build compiles.
//   * DOES NOT prove anything about the device's own SDL (2.0.9) or about how ArkOS enumerates the built-in
//     controls. Virtual joysticks do not exist in 2.0.9 - which is why this test is PC only. Every SDL call the
//     game itself makes (SDL_JoystickInstanceID, SDL_GameControllerGetJoystick, the `which` field of the joystick
//     and controller events) has been in SDL since 2.0.0 and is present in the device's headers.
