A hopping game for the **R36S** handheld and other ArkOS devices: a native C++17 build on SDL2 and OpenGL ES 2,
640×480, installed through the console's Ports menu.

Current build: **v028**.

## Windows x64

`BobrHopper-Windows-<ver>.zip`: unpack anywhere and run `BobrHopper.exe`. Resizable window (the UI rescales live),
Alt+Enter / F11 fullscreen, mouse and touch screen (tap = hop forward, swipe = hop sideways/back, on-screen buttons
clickable), controller choice in the settings (arrows, WSAD, detected pads, hot-plug; a disconnected pad falls back to
the keyboard), arrow keys always drive player 1. Build: `powershell -File tools/package_windows.ps1`.

## Batocera: ARM handhelds and x86 PCs

This repository (https://github.com/romario997/BobrHopper-Batocera-ARM-X86-Win64) adds **Batocera** builds next to the R36S one (release packages: `BobrHopper-Batocera-<ver>.zip` for ARM,
`BobrHopper-BatoceraPC-<ver>.zip` for x86_64):

- **ARM** (tested on the Anbernic **RG35XX H**, community Batocera v40, Mali-G31): two binaries in one package,
  `bobrhopper.aarch64` (64-bit Batocera, e.g. v43+ on the H700) and `bobrhopper.armhf` (the 32-bit userland of the
  RG35XX H community build). `port/batocera/BobrHopper.sh` picks the binary by the system's dynamic loader and tries
  the SDL video drivers in turn (wayland, x11, mali, kmsdrm, default), remembering the one that worked. The built-in
  pad's A/B are swapped back to their printed labels (Batocera maps by position).
- **x86_64 PC** (Batocera 42): the UI scales with the screen (1080p = 2.25x, outlines included, fonts baked at the
  real size), 16:9 shows more of the world sideways instead of stretching.
- **Menu artwork**: `ports/images/BobrHopper-{image,thumb,marquee}.png` and a `gamelist.xml` entry.
- **Installer**: unpack the zip on Windows and run `WGRAJ_NA_KONSOLE.bat` (ARM) or `WGRAJ_NA_BATOCERE_PC.bat` (PC).
  It finds the SD card / USB drive (or `\\BATOCERA\share` over the network), **asks before writing**, copies the game
  to `roms/ports`, and merges the menu entry into `roms/ports/gamelist.xml` (keeping a backup). Settings and the best
  score in `bobrhopper/conf` survive a reinstall.
- **10 languages**: English, Polish, Spanish, Latin, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Romanian, Volapük, Esperanto (the baked
  font draws all their letters).

```sh
sh build/build_batocera.sh        # -> out/batocera/bobrhopper.aarch64 + bobrhopper.armhf
sh build/build_batocera_x86.sh    # -> out/batocera-x86/bobrhopper.x86_64
python tools/make_batocera_media.py && python tools/make_batocera_x86_media.py
powershell -File tools/package_batocera.ps1       # -> out/package/BobrHopper-Batocera-<ver>.zip
powershell -File tools/package_batocera_x86.ps1   # -> out/package/BobrHopper-BatoceraPC-<ver>.zip
```

The armhf and x86_64 builds link against SDL2 2.0.9 from Debian buster sysroots made in WSL (`debootstrap --arch=armhf`
/ `amd64`, like `build/setup_tools.sh` does for arm64), copied to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BobrHopper\tools\armhf-sdl2` and
`amd64-sdl2`.

## What this is based on

The game logic is a port of **[EvanBacon/expo-crossy-road](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-crossy-road)**
(MIT, commit `6f2e84e5`) — an open-source TypeScript + three.js game. Its structure, timings and behaviour were
followed closely: rows, traffic, logs and the hero's hop reproduce what the original does, and the repository
keeps a trace harness that compares this port against a reference run of the original, step by step.

**This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Hipster Whale, Yodo1 or the "Crossy Road"
game or trademark.** It is a hobby port of an MIT-licensed open-source project, with its own name, its own
artwork and its own sounds. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

## What was added on top of the original

- **Progression mode** beside the endless Classic mode: levels of 10·k rows with a chequered finish line, a
  career that remembers the level reached, a rank for every level, and a fanfare halfway through.
- **Two players on one screen.** Classic becomes a duel: fall too far behind and you are out of the frame, the
  other one plays on, and the higher score wins. Progression is co-operative: the leader is pulled back onto the
  other's head, and a player who dies comes back on its partner's head a couple of seconds later. Land on the
  other player and you stand on its head until it hops away, and every row then offers at least two ways
  through. The view widens by itself; here that is only a camera scale, so nothing extra is loaded.
  Player two needs a second pad; SDL tells the two apart by themselves.
- **A difficulty curve that keeps going.** The first rows are gentle for small children; from 150 points the
  *slowest* traffic, logs and railroad spacing are cut away one layer at a time, and the minimum number of
  dangerous rows in a row keeps climbing with no ceiling (`src/game/difficulty.h`).
- **A guaranteed way forward:** every generated row is checked to be crossable (`build/path_check.sh`).
- **Our own hero and artwork:** a voxel beaver (`tools/make_beaver.py`) as the default character, the chicken
  kept as an alternative, an isometric wordmark (`tools/make_logo.py`), and **every sound effect replaced** with
  our own recordings and generated takes.
- **English and Polish** interface text, chosen in the settings.
- Fixes to behaviour the original shares with its own source: a chain of fast hops could carry the hero over a
  river or a railway. Each fix has a check script in `build/`.

Every deliberate deviation from the original sits behind `GameContext::originalBehaviour`, so the trace
comparison against the original still runs clean.

## Building

You need **Windows with Git Bash** and **Python 3** (the bakers use Pillow: `pip install pillow fonttools`), plus
**WSL** with Ubuntu 22.04 for the ELF checks. `build/setup_tools.sh` fetches the rest: zig 0.14.1 (which builds
both the PC executable and the aarch64 binary) and the SDL2 headers and library the device build links against.

```sh
sh build/setup_tools.sh
sh build/bake_all.sh                 # unpacks the upstream assets and bakes data/
sh build/build_r36s.sh bobrhopper    # -> out/r36s/bobrhopper.aarch64 (+ check_elf)
```

The binary is deliberately narrow: GLIBC 2.28 or older, and nothing in `NEEDED` beyond
`libSDL2-2.0.so.0`, `libc`, `libm`, `libdl` and `libpthread` — every GL entry point is resolved through
`SDL_GL_GetProcAddress`, because the Mali driver's soname on ArkOS is not predictable. `build/check_elf.sh`
fails the build if that ever stops being true.

Package it for a card:

```sh
powershell -File tools/package_r36s.ps1 -Version v028   # -> out/package/BobrHopper-R36S-v028.zip
```

## Installing on the console

Unpack the zip into the card's **EASYROMS** partition so its `ports` folder merges with the existing one:

```
EASYROMS\ports\BobrHopper.sh
EASYROMS\ports\bobrhopper\bobrhopper.aarch64
EASYROMS\ports\bobrhopper\data\...
```

Then **Ports → BobrHopper** in the console's menu. Settings and the best score live in
`ports\bobrhopper\conf\crossy.cfg`; if the game will not start, the launcher leaves
`ports\bobrhopper\bobrhopper-launcher.log` behind.

**Controls:** D-pad hops (on release, like the original), A hops forward / starts a new game, Start pauses,
Select opens the settings, Select + Start quits, Select + L shows the frame counter.

**Two players:** Settings → *Players: 2*, then a device for each of them. The settings list scrolls now that it no
longer fits on one screen. Player two needs a **second controller**: the console's built-in controls are one pad,
and the two are told apart by the instance id SDL puts on every event. The game reports what it found in one line
of `ports/bobrhopper/bobrhopper-launcher.log`:

    input: 2 pad(s) - player one on PAD 1, player two on PAD 2

and picks its defaults from that number, so with one pad nothing changes.

The launcher runs the game natively first (SDL2 KMSDRM + GLES2) and falls back to PortMaster's WestonPack
runtime only if the video setup fails; the working mode is remembered in `conf/video_mode`. There is no
gptokeyb: the game reads the pad itself, and gptokeyb on top doubled every press.

## Testing without the console

```sh
sh build/build_pc.sh bobrhopper   # the same game on the PC, SDL2 + desktop GL
sh build/smoke_test.sh            # a bot plays 20000 steps; the digest must not move
sh build/run_traces.sh            # this port against a reference run of the original
sh build/launcher_test.sh         # the launcher against a fake PortMaster (run it from WSL bash)
```

`build/*_check.sh` are regression checks written for specific bugs — each one's header explains the bug it guards.

## Layout

```
src/game      the game itself, shared by every platform
src/engine    maths, assets, audio, config, and the SDL/GL platform layer
src/ui        HUD, menus, ranks, translations
apps          bobrhopper.cpp is this build; the others are development tools
port          the PortMaster launcher installed as ports/BobrHopper.sh
tools         asset bakers and the card sync script
assets_extra  our own models, images and sounds - a file here overrides the baked upstream asset
release/      built packages, ignored by git (see release/README.md)
```

## Po polsku

**Bóbr Hopper** na konsolę **R36S** (ArkOS): natywna wersja w C++17 na SDL2 i OpenGL ES 2, 640×480, instalowana
przez menu Ports. Logika gry to port otwartoźródłowego projektu **expo-crossy-road** Evana Bacona (licencja MIT).
Projekt **nie jest** powiązany z firmą Hipster Whale ani z grą „Crossy Road" — ma własną nazwę, własną grafikę
i własne dźwięki.

Co doszło ponad pierwowzór: tryb progresji z poziomami, metą i rangami, kariera zapamiętywana między grami,
trudność rosnąca bez końca od 150 punktów, gwarancja przejścia każdego rzędu, bóbr jako domyślny bohater,
własne logo, wszystkie dźwięki wymienione na własne oraz polski i angielski interfejs.

**Tryb dwóch graczy na jednym ekranie**: w ustawieniach *Gracze: 2* i urządzenie dla każdego. W trybie klasycznym
to pojedynek — kto zostanie za daleko w tyle, odpada, a drugi gra dalej; w progresji to współpraca — prowadzący
jest cofany na głowę tego z tyłu, a zabity wraca po chwili na głowie partnera. Kto wskoczy na pole drugiego,
staje mu na głowie, dopóki tamten nie odskoczy; każdy rząd ma wtedy co najmniej dwa wolne przejścia. Drugi gracz
potrzebuje **drugiego pada** — wbudowane kontrolki to jeden kontroler. Ile padów gra znalazła, mówi linia
`input: N pad(s) ...` w `ports/bobrhopper/bobrhopper-launcher.log`.

Instalacja: rozpakuj paczkę na partycję EASYROMS karty, tak żeby folder `ports` połączył się z istniejącym,
i uruchom z menu **Ports → BobrHopper**. Ustawienia i rekord: `ports\bobrhopper\conf\crossy.cfg`.
